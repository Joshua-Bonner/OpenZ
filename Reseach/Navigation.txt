https://github.com/junjunguo/PocketMaps - this application appears to do everything we want to do
	using the same library's and file types. (mapsforge, graphhopper, .osm files)
	It appears to also be easier to understand the implementation when compared to the documentation 
	provided by mapsforge and graphhopper. Try to use this as a guide for implementating ours as a
	Java swing (or similar) program instead of Java Android Application.

After more research that didn't reveal much more in the way of how to use the above librarys and such, I discovered a software program, 
ArcGIS, that has a mapping program for creating maps with various layers as well as an SDK library for the route generation, route 
parameters, and such. ArcGIS Pro is available through PSU for free for students.
