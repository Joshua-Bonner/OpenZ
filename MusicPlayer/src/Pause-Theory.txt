Jacob's Pause wonkiness theory:
Mp3 has mutliple different versions for how you encode the music
CBR - 320, 256 ... etc.
VBR - V0, V1, V2 ... etc.

CBR Stands for "Constant Bit Rate", VBR Stands for "Variable Bit Rate"
I'm pausing it based on the # of byte frames passed, while I'm not 100% why it might matter
    I suspect that songs encoded with VBR V0 vs. CBR 320 will result in the difference
    between some songs / albums playing nice with pause and others not depending on how Javazoom (API I'm using)
    handles variable bit rates.

Example of what i think is happening...
    Think of CBR 320 as this
    [320KB | 320 KB | 320 KB ... ]
    each second contains 320 KB, reguardless
    Think of VBR V0 as this
    [230 KB | 256 KB | 212 KB ... ]

    If Javazoom is assuming a constant bitrate, it may pick up in a spot that is unexpected ...
    I may need to obtain the source code for Javazoom and change it to fix this........................
    Unfortunately, you can find VBR much more commonly than CBR (due to the file size being better for minimal quality loss)

TL;DR - Variable bit rates may the the culprit for this weird behavior
