The GPS program requires two librarys, ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Java and javafx. The project is setup with a gradle build and a maven file.
It also contains a Mobile Map Package file (.mmpk) of the Greater Los Angeles area that is freely availabe to developers with ArcGIS
access. According to the SDK documentation, it is deployable on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms.

As the mmpk file is only for Los Angeles, here are two address that I know are in the map: 
      2251 sunset plaza drive, los angeles, ca
      3456 oak glen drive, los angeles, ca
Extensive testing on how to input the addresses has not been done so input the address exactly are they are above with the exception
of captiol and lower case letters.

This is a ROUGH draft of the program. Please disregard extraneous code, comments, format, indentation, etc.
