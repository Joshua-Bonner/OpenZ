	The goal of the project was to develop and install a custom head unit infotainment system in a motor vehicle. This unit includes lane departure detection, parking collision detection, GPS navigation, system / vehicle diagnostic information, and a music player. </br> </br>
	Lane departure detection uses computer vision to determine when a car is departing from a lane and alert the driver through an auditory signal to correct their positioning in the lane. </br>
	Parking collision detection uses sensors to determine if the driver is at risk of colliding with a static object while parking and will also show a feed of what is behind the car while in reverse. </br>
	GPS will be offline having locally stored maps to use turn by turn navigation. </br>
	The vehicle diagnostics displays internal data to the user such as engine trouble codes, clear the engine code, engine load, throttle position, intake tempertature, and intake pressure. </br>
	The music player plays music from USB and internal memory with the feature tag reading which includes the tags: artist, album art, track name and number. </br>
