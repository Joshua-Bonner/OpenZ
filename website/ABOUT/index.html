<h1> About OpenZ </h1>
<div id=basic>
	OpenZ is a infotainment head unit with Lane Departure Detection, Parking Collision Detection, On Board Diagnostics, GPS direction, and Music Player.

<div id=LDD>
	Lane Departure Detection (LDD) involves a computer vision algorithm using only the Python Image Library (Pillow) which minimizes the overhead on the raspberri pi. It takes an image that is taken by the raspberri pi camera and puts 2 boxes on the left and right sides of the view. Inside of these boxes, it calculates and determines the location of the lanes, or sides of the road are at. In order to determine the location, it calculates a difference in color between the road and the lane, grass, dirt, or curb.

<div id=GPS>
	GPS Navigation uses ArcGIS java SDK library that's available free to students from Penn State. It utilizes a map package, we used the greater Los Angles area map throughout testing. 
</div>
<br>
<div id=UI>
	The UI is coded in Java. It primarily uses the Javax Swing library to create interactive buttons, sliders, tabs, as well as the window itself. The java in the UI also uses references to objects from all other components of OpenZ.
	The images used in the UI (such as for buttons) were made using Paint.net, meaning they are unique to OpenZ, not from the internet.

	Music Player utilizes two Java libraries, Java ID3 Tag Library and the Javazoom Jlayer Library. The Java ID3 Tag library is used to pull the tag information from the music files while Javazoom Jlayer actually makes the songs play. Playing the music occurs on a separate thread and swapping between songs is done another thread utilizing state changes that are called from button presses from the UI or callbacks from Jlayer. 
	We sort album tracks by a modified bucket sort when track numbers are available. Volume changes are done by using an ALSA Mixer to interface with the raspberry pi's audio out drivers which are connected to the speakers in the vehicle.
