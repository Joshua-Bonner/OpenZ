	GPS Navigation uses ArcGIS java SDK library that's available free to students from Penn State. It utilizes a map package, we used the greater Los Angles area map throughout testing.

<div id=UI>
	The UI is coded in Java. It primarily uses the Javax Swing library to create interactive buttons, sliders, tabs, as well as the window itself. The java in the UI also uses references to objects from all other components of OpenZ.
	The images used in the UI (such as for buttons) were made using Paint.net, meaning they are unique to OpenZ, not from the internet.
